AI for healthy: In practice, medical images and text health records are used together to give diagnosis for patients. I'm interested in the development of efficient and hopefully explainable deep learning methods, which may involve with CV/NLP/Multi-modal models, to mimic and assist the this procedure. The following are relevant research experiences.

Tooth Segmentation in CBCT Images <br> 
In computer-assisted orthodontics, three-dimensional tooth models are required for many medical treatments. Tooth segmentation from CBCT images is a crucial step in constructing the models. We recognize the task as 2D semantic segmentation and propose an image-quality robust and teeth structure constrained segmentation method. We show that our method obtains better segmentation results on tooth datasets than the other six advanced medical image segmentation methods.

Transfer Learning for Medical Visual Question Answering <br> 
Recent large-scale pretrained models, such as the CLIP, exhibit an impressive performance on zero-shot and few-shot tasks. We intend to develop methods to efficiently transfer the rich knowledge learned by such models to attain improvements in Medical Visual Question Answering tasks.

Explainable Zero-shot Medical Image Diagnosis with VLMs and LLMs <br> 
Zero-shot medical image classification is a critical process in real-world scenarios where we have limited access to all possible diseases or large-scale annotated data. Recent advances in pretrained VLMs have shown great performance on such tasks. We explore utilizing LLMs to leverage VLMs for diagnosis to a greater extent, and provide explainability of the diagnosis.
